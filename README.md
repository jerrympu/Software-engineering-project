# Stint Time Calculator 

## 1. Graphical Abstract


## 2. Purpose of the Software 
The Stint Time Calculator is designed to help sim racers to accurately calculate stint durations. For endurance racing, it is very critical to have an accurate and precise stint time and stint information for drivers and the team. The software asks user to input the required data so that the software is able to precisely calculate the stint information. User also required to place a driver in each time slot. After, the information are outputted on a time sheet with all the essential information in it. 

Information shown on the time sheet include:
* Required user input:
  * Start time of the race
  * Duration of the race
  * Fuel tank capacity
  * Fuel consumption 
  * Pitlane duration 
  * Tyre change time
  * Driver swap time
  * Refuel speed
  * Drivers & their corresponding lap times
  * Tyre choice
* Automatically calculated:
  * Start & end time for each stint
  * Fuel to be added for each stint
  * Pitstop duration

Development Methodology

Algorithm

Current Status
The software is in implementation stage. The basic coding and algorithm of the software are finished. It is currently runnable in a CLI. We aim to convert the software to be usable on a GUI in the upcoming week. 

Future Plans
- Adding AI-powered predictive analytics to return the best strategy option.
- Enhancing mobile compatibility to be usable on a phone.
